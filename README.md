When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. Here is a series of steps on how to set up the project on your local machine.

Click [Insta-clone](https://github.com/MutuaFranklin/Insta-clone) to navigate on the main page of the project repository on Github.

```
Clone the repository using HTTPS, click "Clone with HTTPS".
```

```
Open Terminal. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
```

```
Type https://github.com/MutuaFranklin/Insta-clone and press Enter to create your local clone.

```

```
Open Insta-clone, the cloned Repo in terminal and run : pip install -r requirements.txt to install the app dependencies

```

```
Run source virtual/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment and python manage.py runserver to launch the app

```

## BDD

- Your project must have a search form that when submitted calls a search function in the view function and redirects to a search results page.
-  When a user clicks on an Image he/she should be redirected to where the image is displayed and should also see the details of the Image.
-  see images filtered by location

- Your application should have a solid authentication system that allows users to sign in or register into the application before using it. When a user registers with your application they should receive a confirmation email.
## Technologies Used

- Python Django Framework
